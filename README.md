# Geolocation Application for IoT sensors using LoRa Gateways 
Implementation and Evaluation of an Application for Geolocation of IoT sensors using LoRa Gateways

# What to do? 

## Visting the Campus for gathering the information for the IoT sensors and the LoRa gateway (Timeline -> 20-25 days)
1) Overview and Analysis of data generated from the IoT sensors. 
2) Retrieval of the signal on the LoRa gateways, the format of the data and all the information necessary for the execution of Geolocation algorithm.

## Can be done remotely with the inputs gathered from the Hardware setup (IoT sensors and the LoRa gateway) (Timeline -> 25-30 days Maximum)
3) Making the input of the geolocation algorithm clear - Multilateration with TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival).

## Software Code Implementation and a minimal application development (Timeline -> 15-25 days)
4) Implementation of algorithm with all the data and getting the results.
5) Testing of the results and continuous feedback loop on results.

## Finalization of Application Development and benchmarking (Timeline -> 15-25 days)
6) Visualisation of the results in a meaningful form either with coordinates systems or on some map API.
7) Evaluation and benchmarking of the final results.
